# getScriptURL Function

## Description

The `getScriptURL` function retrieves the URL of the Google Apps Script web application. This function is useful for obtaining the deployed URL of the script, which can be shared or used in other parts of your application to direct users or services to the web app.

## Function Signature

```javascript
function getScriptURL() {
  return ScriptApp.getService().getUrl();
}
```

## Usage

This function is typically used in scenarios where you need to programmatically access or reference the URL of your Google Apps Script web application. It's beneficial for dynamically generating links or for when you need to interact with the web app from external services or interfaces.

## Parameters

The function does not take any parameters.

## Examples

An example scenario demonstrating the use of `getScriptURL` could be logging the current script's URL:
```javascript
// Log the script URL
function logScriptURL() {
  const url = getScriptURL();
  Logger.log("The script URL is: " + url);
}
```
This example logs the URL of the script to the console, which can be useful for debugging or sharing with users.

## Notes
- Ensure the script is deployed as a web app, as `ScriptApp.getService().getUrl()` will only return a URL if the script is deployed appropriately.
- The returned URL is the one associated with the current version deployed, not necessarily the latest changes in development.
- If the script is not deployed as a web application, the function will not return a valid URL.
