# saveData Function

## Description

The `saveData` function appends a new row of data to a pre-initialized sheet in a Google Sheets document. It collects a unique ID, the current date, and the active user's email to record an entry. This function is useful for logging or recording transactions, form submissions, or similar structured data entries.

## Function Signature

```javascript
function saveData(formObject) {
  initSpreadSheet();
  const sheet = dataSheet;
  const user = getUser();
  const ID = getCustomUUID();
  const NO = getLastNo(sheet);
  sheet.appendRow([
    NO,
    ID,
    new Date(), 
    user,
  ]);
  return 'SUCCESS';
}
```

## Usage

This function is ideal for applications where you need to capture data input from users and store it persistently on a Google Sheet. It combines several attributes into each log entry, such as a unique identifier and user information.

## Parameters

- `formObject` (object): Although specified as a parameter, this function doesn't directly utilize it within its current implementation. Consider revising if additional form data is intended to be included.

## Examples

Here's a conceptual example of how to use the `saveData` function, considering necessary setup and function calls:
```javascript
// Assuming other functions like initSpreadSheet, getUser, getCustomUUID, and getLastNo are correctly implemented

// Dummy form object for example; update function to use form data as needed
const formObject = {};

// Call saveData to log an entry to the sheet
const status = saveData(formObject);
Logger.log("Data save status: " + status);
```

## Notes

Sheet Initialization: Ensure `initSpreadSheet` is effectively setting up the `dataSheet` variable where the data is to be appended.
Utilities and Dependencies: The function relies on auxiliary functions such as `getUser`, `getCustomUUID`, and `getLastNo`. Ensure these are correctly defined to avoid runtime errors.
    `getUser()`: Returns the active user's email.
    `getCustomUUID()`: Should generate a unique identifier.
    `getLastNo(sheet)`: Determines the next sequential number or identifier.
Data Security: Be cautious while managing user data, ensuring you comply with privacy policies and guidelines.
FormObject Usage: If additional form data is necessary, consider updating the implementation to include more fields from `formObject`.
