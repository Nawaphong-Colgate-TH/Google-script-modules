# getUser Function

## Description

The `getUser` function retrieves the email address of the currently active user executing the script. This function is crucial for scenarios where user identification or personalization is required based on the active user's credentials.

## Function Signature

```javascript
function getUser() {
  return Session.getActiveUser().getEmail();
}
```

## Usage

This function is useful for logging, tracking, and personalizing content or features based on the user executing the script. It allows applications to react differently depending on the user's identity.

## Parameters

The function does not take any parameters.

## Examples

Here's an example of how you might use the `getUser` function to log or verify the executing user's email:
```javascript
// Log the active user's email
function logUserEmail() {
  const userEmail = getUser();
  Logger.log("Current user email: " + userEmail);
}
```
This example captures the active user's email and logs it, which can be useful for auditing or personalization purposes.

## Notes
- The `Session.getActiveUser().getEmail()` method retrieves the email of the user currently executing the script, which may differ based on authorization and sharing settings.
- If the script is deployed as a web application or part of a document where anonymous access is allowed, this function might not return the user's email unless the required scopes and permissions are correctly set.
- Ensure that the script has appropriate permissions to access user email information, and be aware of privacy considerations when handling user data.
