# extractFileIdFromUrl and reUrlImage Functions

## Description

The `extractFileIdFromUrl` function is designed to extract the unique file ID from a Google Drive URL. This ID is essential for accessing or manipulating files using Google's API. 

The `eUrlImage` function utilizes this file ID to create a direct image URL for easier viewing or embedding. Together, these functions streamline the process of managing images or files linked within Google Drive URLs.

## Function Signature

```javascript
function extractFileIdFromUrl(url) {
  const regex = /\/d\/([^/]+)\//;
  const matches = url.match(regex);
  return matches ? matches[1] : ''; // Return the ID or empty string if not matched
}

function reUrlImage(url) {
  const id = extractFileIdFromUrl(url);
  if (id) {
    return "https://lh3.google.com/d/" + id;
  } 
  return url;
}
```

## Usage

These functions are particularly useful in applications that need to manipulate Google Drive URLs to extract file IDs and convert them into viewable image URLs. They can be integrated into systems that require image processing, displaying, or sharing Google Drive images on the web.

## Parameters

- `extractFileIdFromUrl`:
    - `url` (string): The Google Drive file URL from which to extract the file ID.
- `reUrlImage`:
    - `url` (string): The original Google Drive file URL intended for image URL conversion.

## Examples

Example for `extractFileIdFromUrl`
```javascript
// Example URL
const fileUrl = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1abc23D45fgHIKlmNOPQR67/view";
const fileId = extractFileIdFromUrl(fileUrl);
Logger.log("Extracted File ID: " + fileId); // Output: 1abc23D45fgHIKlmNOPQR67
```
Example for `reUrlImage`
```javascript
// Reconstruct Image URL
const driveUrl = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1abc23D45fgHIKlmNOPQR67/view";
const imageUrl = reUrlImage(driveUrl);
Logger.log("Image URL: " + imageUrl); // Output: https://lh3.google.com/d/1abc23D45fgHIKlmNOPQR67
```

## Notes

- **Regular Expression**: The extract function uses a regular expression to parse URLs. It specifically looks for the pattern `/d/<file-id>/` prevalent in Google Drive URLs.
- **Direct URLs**: The reUrlImage function constructs a direct Google-hosted image URL, which could have restrictions based on file sharing permissions.
- **Return Behavior**: If the URL does not contain a recognizable file ID pattern, `extractFileIdFromUrl` returns an empty string, and `reUrlImage` returns the original URL.
- **Integration**: These functions are optimal for applications needing URL handling, modification, or data extraction from Google Drive links.
